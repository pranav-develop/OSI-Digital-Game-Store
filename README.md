Internship Project By Innovation Club KIET

This Project was made by me during my internship in Innovation Club at KIET Group Of Institutions however have only made a static website during Internship period.
I have also selected to extend the functionality of this and also making it dynamic as a mini-project in 3rd semester.

I am currently working on dynamic part and also creating database.

Static Code does not contain all the pages such as settings & profile etc.
